pyactivemq
=====================

This is a python wrapper around the ActiveMQ-CPP library ("CMS":https://activemq.apache.org/cms/).

To install pyactivemq you need to download "ActiveMQ-CPP":https://activemq.apache.org/cms/activemq-cpp-370-release.html 
and unzip it to your @/opt@ folder.

Then go to the folder and type:

<pre>
sudo python setup.py install
</pre>

This will compile and install the pyactivemq library into your python environment.
